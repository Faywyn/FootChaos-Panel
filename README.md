# FootChaos-Panel

The dashboard serves as a platform to streamline the management of AI training sessions,
specifically tailored for FootChaos, a 2D car game reminiscent of Rocket League.
However, it can be adapted to other systems with minor modifications.
 
It encompasses the following key features:
-  The Creation and Management of Training Sessions: Users can initiate new training
sessions on the main page by specifying the number of networks and group sizes.
Additionally, they have the option to commence an existing training session from the same page. 
-  Results Analysis Page: This section offers a comprehensive analysis of the results,
presented through a graphical interface showcasing various data points relative to the
generation. Users can track the performance of their networks over time, enabling them
to make informed decisions to enhance the effectiveness of their training sessions. 

 In essence, the dashboard provides an intuitive and **simple** interface for managing FootChaos-AI
 training sessions, offering tools for creation, monitoring, and optimization of neural
 network performance, primarily tailored for FootChaos while being adaptable to other
 systems with appropriate adjustments.
